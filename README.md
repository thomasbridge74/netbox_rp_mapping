# Static RP Mapping setup for Netbox

This is being developed as a plugin to manage static RP mappings for multicast groups inside Netbox.

The idea is that when complete, the plugin will be able
to generate the static RP configurations required for 
network devices.   In particular it will support
the construction of the ACLs referenced by the commands on both
Cisco and Arista platforms.

This is currently very much a work in progress.
